# training-log
A Spring Boot-based website with elements of jQuery and REST API. Built as a single-page application.

The purpose of the website is to provide an overview of gym activities: it allows to create a training day log using predefined entries from the DB table.

The database is MySQL, the access is provided via the Spring Data framework.

The controller maps the "/" with the index page, and processes REST requests from the jQuery Ajax code.

The CSS framework is Bootstrap, nothing special, just for demo purposes.
